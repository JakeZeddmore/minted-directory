### CRM
A CRM (customer resource management) is a common type of business software.

A CRM is used to keep track of customers of a business.

The exact way this software is used can vary highly from business to business because of differences in how they operate.

Most CRMs allow you to:
+ create customers
+ assign them to one or more employees.
+ save files and other metadata tied to the customer.

### Marketing Website

Agency OS also includes a marketing website which is built with Nuxt.

This website can be used to:
+ present the benefits of the agency to potential clients.
+ show of past projects of the agency as case studies.
+ write articles for content based marketing of the agency.

### Client Portal

A client portal can be a valuable addition to the toolbox of an agency. 
It let's clients of your agency login to a platform where you can provide them updates of how their project is progressing.
